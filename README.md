Website for Sympnoia: A shared ethical and philosophical journey.

## Philosophy Entries

Add new papers to the `_philosophy` directory. Each file only needs standard front matter with `layout: philosophy` followed by your markdown content. The philosophy layout automatically provides the styled container and options button, so do not include your own `<style>` or `<main>` wrappers.

Within the reader you can adjust the color scheme and width using the options
button in the top-right corner. Five accessible color presets and three width
choices are provided. Defaults are applied so pages render correctly even when
JavaScript is disabled.
