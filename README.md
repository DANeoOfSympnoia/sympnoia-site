Website for Sympnoia: A shared ethical and philosophical journey.

## Philosophy Entries

Add new papers to the `_philosophy` directory. Each file only needs standard front matter with `layout: philosophy` followed by your markdown content. The philosophy layout automatically provides the styled container and options button, so do not include your own `<style>` or `<main>` wrappers.

Within the reader you can adjust the color scheme, font style, font size and width using the options
button in the top-right corner. Five accessible color presets (Olive is the default) and three width
choices are provided. Four font pairings and four font sizes are available. Defaults are applied so pages render correctly even when
JavaScript is disabled.
