    <p>
      This work explores the metaphysical and theological implications of asking
      the question of questions: What is the root of existence itself? It argues
      that the foundation of all that is must lie beyond perceivable being
      itself—a metaphysical Ground that gives rise to existence, intelligibility,
      and relation. Through rigorous reasoning, it reframes the concept of
      divinity not as a supreme being, but as the enabling condition of reality.
      Rooted in the ethos of Sympnoia, it calls for a theology grounded not in
      dogma, but in shared, rational inquiry into the deepest structures of
      existence.
