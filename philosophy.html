        This work explores the metaphysical and theological implications of asking the question of questions: What is the root of existence itself? It argues that the foundation of all that is must lie beyond perceivable being itself—
        a metaphysical Ground that gives rise to existence, intelligibility, and relation. Through rigorous reasoning, it reframes the concept of divinity not as a supreme being, but as the enabling condition of reality. Rooted in the ethos of
        Sympnoia, it calls for a theology grounded not in dogma, but in shared, rational inquiry into the deepest structures of existence.
