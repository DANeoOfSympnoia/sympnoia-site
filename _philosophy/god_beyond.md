summary: >-
  This work explores the metaphysical and theological implications of asking the
  question of questions: What is the root of existence itself? It argues that
  the foundation of all that is must lie beyond perceivable being itselfâ€”a
  metaphysical Ground that gives rise to existence, intelligibility, and
  relation. Through rigorous reasoning, it reframes the concept of divinity not
  as a supreme being, but as the enabling condition of reality.
